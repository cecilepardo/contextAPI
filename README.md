# learn___api-consumption

This project was created to practice and learn how to consume APIs in a React application.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to understand and experiment with:
- fetching data from APIs
- displaying data in React components
- managing component state
- handling loading and error states

This project is part of my learning process.

## What I practiced

- Using `fetch` or `axios` to retrieve data from an API
- Displaying dynamic data in React components
- Handling asynchronous requests with `useEffect` and state hooks
- Updating the UI based on API responses
- Basic error handling in React

## Status

This is a learning project and is not intended for production use.

## Notes

- This repository serves as a reference for my React learning journey.  
- The focus is on understanding API consumption and React fundamentals.
